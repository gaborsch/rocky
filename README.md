# Rocky - Rockstar Java interpreter

Rocky is a 100% [Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/) compatible RockStar Interpreter, written in Java. Have fun and play with it! Should you have any issues, requests, wishes or troubles, open a ticket for it and I'll help you to resolve. 

Rocky supports all Rockstar language features announced on 2021.10.12 and before, including Rockstar 2.0 additions (arrays). If you miss any feature, please open an issue for it.

**Features include:**
* Fully compliant Rockstar implementation to date (all of the tests are OK, except the reported bugs)
* Advanced Debugger mode (Step into/over/return/run, Breakpoints, watches, examine variable, trace expression evaluation!)
* Interactive terminal mode (REPL - Read - Eval - Print Loop)
* List command (parse a file without running it) (`-x` option prints the AST)
* Detailed help with options explanation
* IEEE754 maths (double precision), or optionally Dec64 (with option `--dec64`)

**Special features:** 
* [Object Oriented Programming](OOP.md) in Rockstar! Yes, you can write OOP code in Rockstar!
* Advanced array management features
* For all additional feature details [check the extras page!](spec_ext.md)


### Prerequisites

Rocky requires at least Java8 JRE to run. The `rockstar.bat` and `rockstar` wrappers make it easy to execute on Windows and Unix. Alternatively you can also use Docker to run.

### Install

To install and run, you only need the [`rocky.jar`](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky/tree/master/rocky.jar)  file, and one of the wrappers ([`rockstar.bat`](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky/tree/master/rockstar.bat) or [`rockstar`](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky/tree/master/rockstar), depending on your OS). Make sure that `java` is on your path and you can run it immediately. The rest of the files are for development.

If you are on Linux, you can execute [`sudo install.sh`](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky/tree/master/install.sh) - this will create a runnable binary `/usr/bin/rockstar`, so your Rockstar programs could be run like a script with `#!/usr/bin/rockstar` shebang header. 

There are some Rockstar program in the [programs](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky/tree/master/programs) folder and its subfolders, you may want to check them, too. They're mostly for test purposes, but you can peek into if you want to get inspired or check some features.

#### Install for Docker 

If you don't have Java on your machine, you can run Rockstar within a Docker container. There is a [`dockstar`](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky/tree/master/dockstar) command for you, where everything works just like with the `rockstar` command, but the image is run within Docker. The only difference is that you have to replace `\` path separators to `/` unix-style on command line.

```
./dockstar help
./dockstar programs/fizzbuzz.rock
./dockstar debug programs/fizzbuzz.rock
```

### Docker image

You can also create a docker image using the following command:
```
docker build -t rockstar .
``` 
Once created, you can use the container to run Rocky. Here are some sample commands:
* Get help: `docker run --rm rockstar help`
* Run a program: `docker run --rm -v ${pwd}:/local rockstar /local/programs/gameoflife.rock`
* Run a program (with input): `docker run --rm -v ${pwd}:/local --interactive --tty rockstar /local/programs/modulus.rock`

### How to use:

It's very easy to run a program:
```
$ ./rockstar programs/modulus.rock 
Enter Dividend:
100
Enter Divisor:
7
The modulus is 2
```
To list (and parse) a program, try `list`. Note, that it is the parsed version, with indentations, to help better understanding (whitespaces do not count in Rockstar).
```
$ ./rockstar list programs/modulus.rock

  Modulus takes Number and Divisor
    Put Divisor into Big Divisor
    While Big Divisor is less than Number
      Put Big Divisor times 2 into Big Divisor

    While Big Divisor is as high as Divisor
      If Number is as high as Big Divisor
        Put Number minus Big Divisor into Number

      Put Big Divisor over 2 into Big Divisor

    Give back Number

  say "Enter Dividend:"
  Listen to X
  say "Enter Divisor:"
  Listen to Y
  say "The modulus is " with Modulus taking X and Y
```

Do you want to get acquainted with Rockstar? Try the REPL (interactive) mode, start Rockstar with `-` option:

```
$ ./rockstar -
Rockstar Java by gaborsch, Version 2.0.1 (with OOP)
-------------------------------------------------
Type 'exit' to quit, 'show' to get more info.
> My name is Gabor
> What's your name?
> Say my name
5
> show var
Variables:
what = 44
my name = 5
> exit
```
There are other possibilities as well, like debug mode (detailed description coming soon) or help for each command:
```
$ ./rockstar help
Rockstar Java by gaborsch, Version 2.0.1 (with OOP)
---------------------------------------------------
Usage:
rockstar <filename> ...
rockstar run [--options ...] <filename> ...
    Execute a program. Input is taken from standard input, output is printed to standard output.
rockstar debug [--options ...] <filename> ...
    Debug a program interactively. Stop at breakpoints, lines, display and watch variables.
rockstar list [--options ...] <filename> ...
    Parse and list a program. Useful for syntax checking.
rockstar - [<filename> ...]
rockstar repl [<filename> ...]
    Start an interactive session (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). Enter commands and execute them immediately.
    The specified programs are pre-run (e.g. defining functions, etc). Special commands are available.
rockstar test [--options ...] <file-or-dirname> ...
    Execute unit tests. Special rules apply, check `rockstar help test` for details
rockstar [-h|--help]
rockstar help
    Print this help.
rockstar help <command>
    Print more detailed help about the given command.
```

Each command has a more detailed help with options, so try `rockstar help run`, `rockstar help debug`, `rockstar help repl`, etc.

### Test results

*100%* of the tests have passed! With a buggy test case fixed locally ( https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar/issues/203 ), everything works!

Also, I included OOP tests and Rocky extension tests that do not pass on other Rockstar implementations.
