The river is ice
The child is gone
The night is drawing near
Fear is distant so
Let darkness be the night without fear

Listen to the fire
Until the fire is empty
Let the light be the fire over the river
Turn down the light
Let the light be without darkness
Let the child be with the light
Listen to the fire

Whisper the child
